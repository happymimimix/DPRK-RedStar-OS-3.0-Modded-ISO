# DPRK-RedStar-OS-3.0-Modded-ISO
This repository contain the modified RedStar OS 3.0 Installation image made by myself. 
Providing a better experience for foreigners. 

## What has been tweaked? 
1. The installer is now in English. 
2. Added an auto run script in the iso that changes the system display language and removes spyware. 

## What is the difference between regular edition and special edition? 
Regular edition contains an auto run script that removes spyware. 
Special edition changes the language only, useful if you want to do researches on the spyware. 

## Installation guide: 
1. Choose windows xp as the guest operating system. 
2. Mount the installation image in the virtual machine. 
3. Proceed installation just like what you do with Mac OS. 
4. After rebooting, mount the installation image into the VM and execute my auto run script. 
5. The language should be channged to English when finished. 
6. If you are installing the regular edition, you can now install vmware tools to make your experience better. 
   Warning: Do not install vmware tools in the normal way, that will install the wrong version which is too new for red star. 
   There's a perfect version of vmware tools that I've been looking for a long time on the desktop, please use that one instead. 

## Note: 
The OS is in korean on default, and I have no idea of how to pre-configure this thing in the iso. 
So I did it in another way, I wrote an auto run script that will change the language to english when excuted. 
Don't be surprised if you saw the system display language unchanged when you finished installing. 
Just simply mount the installation image in your VM and run my auto run script.
